Audio file specifications

The Authoring app can record audio for your scenarios. It creates .wav files at CD quality (Sample rate: 44.1 kHz, Bit depth: 16). If you plan to use your own audio recordings, it is recommended that it is recorded using the same sample rate and bit depth for maximum compatibility on all platforms.
